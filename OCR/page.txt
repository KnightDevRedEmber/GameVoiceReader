-- READY! --

Keep this tab open on the Edge browser, then start the Game Voice Reader script.

You can move the Edge window to a second monitor or make its window really small to keep it out of the way.

Games must not be running in Exclusive Fullscreen mode.

Hold down the 'side mouse button 2' to activate, read the README for more controls.
